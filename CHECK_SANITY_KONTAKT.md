# 🔍 Sanity Studio Check - URGENT

## The Problem

The Kontakt page looks exactly the same - NO changes are visible:
- ❌ No "Kontakt" text on hero image
- ❌ Form is not 2-column layout
- ❌ No gradient overlay visible

## Possible Causes

1. **Sanity Studio: Page NOT populated**
   - The Kontakt page might not have a `heroGradient` block
   - The Kontakt page might not have a `contactSimple` block
   
2. **Components NOT rendering**
   - Data is there but components are broken
   - CSS/styling issues

3. **Browser cache**
   - Hard refresh not working

---

## ✅ ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Check Sanity Studio

1. Open Sanity Studio: `http://localhost:3333`
2. Find the "Pages" document type
3. Look for a page with slug `kontakt`

**Questions:**
- Does the "Kontakt" page exist?
- Does it have any content blocks?
- If YES: What blocks does it have?

### Step 2: If Page Exists, Check Content

For the `heroGradient` block:
- ✅ Does it have a **Headline** field filled in? (e.g., "Kontakt")
- ✅ Does it have a **Background Image** selected?
- ✅ What is the **Gradient Direction**? (left or right)
- ✅ What is the **Section Height**? (small, medium, or large)

For the `contactSimple` block:
- ✅ Does it have a **Form Headline**? (e.g., "Kontaktformular")
- ✅ Does it have **Labels** filled in?
- ✅ Does it have **Address** fields filled in?

### Step 3: If Page Does NOT Exist

**Create it:**
1. In Sanity Studio, click "+ Create" → "Page"
2. Set **Title**: "Kontakt"
3. Set **Slug**: "kontakt"
4. Click "Add Content" → "Hero Gradient"
   - Headline: "Kontakt"
   - Background Image: (upload the balcony photo)
   - Gradient Direction: left
   - Section Height: medium
5. Click "Add Content" → "Contact Simple"
   - Form Headline: "Kontaktformular"
   - Labels: Fill in all form labels
   - Address: Fill in company address
6. Click "Publish"

## 🔍 Browser DevTools Check

Open the Kontakt page in browser and:
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any red errors
4. Share what you see

Also:
1. Right-click on the hero image → **Inspect**
2. Look for an element with class `absolute` and `left-[50px]`
3. Does it exist? What CSS properties does it have?

---

## 📊 Quick Visual Check

Looking at your screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ Image is present (the balcony photo)
- ❌ NO text "Kontakt" visible on image
- ❌ NO 2-column layout for form (only left column visible)

This suggests either:
1. The HeroGradient block has NO headline text in Sanity
2. The CSS is broken and text is hidden/invisible
3. Z-index stacking is wrong

## 🚨 MOST LIKELY CAUSE

**The Kontakt page in Sanity Studio is NOT populated yet.**

You need to go to Sanity Studio and:
1. Create/edit the "Kontakt" page document
2. Add heroGradient block with headline + image
3. Add contactSimple block with form fields
4. Publish the page
5. Refresh the frontend

**Please confirm:**
- Have you created the "Kontakt" page in Sanity Studio?
- Have you added the heroGradient and contactSimple blocks?
- Have you filled in all the fields?
- Have you published the page?
