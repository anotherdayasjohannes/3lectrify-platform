# ðŸ”§ Build Errors Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The Vercel build failed with TypeScript errors:

1. **FeatureShowcase Component** - Missing `heading` property
   - The component expects both `title` (for navigation) and `heading` (for content)
   - We were only mapping `title` from Sanity data
   
2. **Unused Imports** - ESLint warnings
   - `Hero` and `PortableTextBlock` in kontakt/page.tsx
   - `Image` and `imageUrl` in FeatureDesign.tsx

---

## What I Fixed

### âœ… `/app/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Changed `title={block.title}` â†’ `sectionHeadline={block.sectionHeadline}`
- Added `sectionIntro={block.sectionIntro}`
- Added `heading: feature.heading` to feature mapping

### âœ… `/app/kontakt/page.tsx`
- Removed unused `Hero` import
- Removed unused `PortableTextBlock` type import

### âœ… `/components/FeatureDesign.tsx`
- Removed unused `Image` import
- Removed unused `imageUrl` prop

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy Again

**Run this command to push the fix:**

```bash
cd /Users/j.wild/Projects/3lectrify-platform && git push origin main
```

This will trigger a new Vercel deployment that should succeed! âœ…

## What Changed

| File | Change | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `[slug]/page.tsx` | Added `heading` mapping | TypeScript error - required property |
| `[slug]/page.tsx` | Fixed prop names | Used wrong prop names for FeatureShowcase |
| `kontakt/page.tsx` | Removed imports | Unused variables causing warnings |
| `FeatureDesign.tsx` | Removed imports | Unused variables causing warnings |

**Build should now succeed!** ðŸŽ¯
