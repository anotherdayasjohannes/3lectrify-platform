## Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: "How much did this cost?"

### Q: "Can we still use HubSpot forms?"
**A:** *"Yes! The contact form still integrates with HubSpot. We kept that connection."*

### Q: "What if we want to add a new type of content?"
**A:** *"I can build a new component in a day. Then content team can use it everywhere."*

### Q: "Is it as fast as it looks?"
**A:** *"Faster. Next.js is optimized for performance. Global CDN means millisecond load times worldwide."*

### Q: "What happens if Sanity goes down?"
**A:** *"The live site still works - it's statically generated. Plus we can export all our content anytime."*

### Q: "How hard is it to use Sanity compared to HubSpot?"
**A:** *"Easier. Cleaner interface, more intuitive, better organized."*

### Q: "Can we go back to HubSpot if we need to?"
**A:** *"We could, but you won't want to. This is better in every way."*
