# ✨ SplitText Hero Animations - LIVE!

**GSAP is now FREE thanks to Webflow!** 🎉

## 🎬 What We Just Built

### **Stunning Word-by-Word Text Reveals** 
Your hero headlines now animate in word-by-word with beautiful fade + slide effects!

---

## 📦 What's Implemented

### 1. **`useTextReveal` Hook** (`packages/animations/`)
- ✅ Smart fallback system (works with or without SplitText plugin)
- ✅ Custom word-splitting when plugin unavailable
- ✅ Fully configurable (timing, stagger, easing)
- ✅ Accessibility-first (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- ✅ TypeScript types included

### 2. **HeroGradient Component** (`packages/ui/`)
- ✅ Headline animates in (words fade + slide up)
- ✅ Subheadline follows with perfect timing
- ✅ Zero layout shift
- ✅ Performance optimized

---

## ⚡ Animation Details

### **Headline:**
- Splits into words
- Each word: fade + 30px slide up
- Stagger: 0.08s between words
- Duration: 0.6s per word
- Delay: 0.3s before start
- Easing: `power3.out`

### **Subheadline:**
- Splits into words
- Each word: fade + 20px slide up
- Stagger: 0.05s between words
- Duration: 0.5s per word
- Delay: 0.8s (starts after headline)
- Easing: `power3.out`

---

## 🎨 The Effect

```
Page loads
   ↓
   Wait 0.3s
   ↓
"Profitable" → "All-Electric" → "Buildings"
   (each word fades + slides in, 0.08s apart)
   ↓
   Wait until headline done + 0.5s
   ↓
"Your" → "subheadline" → "text" → "here"
   (each word fades + slides in, 0.05s apart)
```

**Result:** Elegant, professional, eye-catching entrance!

---

## 🚀 Where It's Active

- ✅ **All HeroGradient components** (home, all pages)
- ✅ Automatically applies to all existing content
- ✅ No Sanity Studio changes needed

---

## 🎛️ How to Use Elsewhere

```tsx
import { useTextReveal } from '@3lectrify/animations';

function MyComponent() {
  const headlineRef = useTextReveal({
    split: 'words',      // or 'chars', 'lines'
    stagger: 0.08,       // delay between elements
    duration: 0.6,       // animation duration
    yDistance: 30,       // slide distance (px)
    ease: 'power3.out',  // easing function
    delay: 0.3,          // delay before start
  });

  return <h1 ref={headlineRef}>Your Text Here</h1>;
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Smart Fallback System:**
1. **Tries** to load GSAP SplitText plugin
2. **If available:** Uses professional SplitText
3. **If not:** Uses custom word-splitting fallback
4. **Result:** Works immediately, upgradeable later

### **Accessibility:**
- ✅ Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- ✅ No animation for users who prefer reduced motion
- ✅ Text always readable (no flash of unstyled content)

### **Performance:**
- ✅ `will-change` hints for smooth animation
- ✅ Automatic cleanup after animation
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ GPU-accelerated transforms
