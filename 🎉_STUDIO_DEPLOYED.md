## 🎯 What We Accomplished

   - Much more reliable than Vercel for Studio
   - Built specifically for Sanity
   - Zero configuration headaches

2. ✅ **Configured Auto-Updates**
   - Studio will auto-update to latest version
   - No manual maintenance needed

3. ✅ **Fixed React Compatibility**
   - Downgraded from React 19 to React 18
   - Resolved all "Workspace: missing context value" errors

4. ✅ **Set up Studio Hostname**
   - `electrify-studio.sanity.studio`
   - Permanent URL for your team

## 🔄 Workflow for Content Changes

### **For Uli (Editor):**

1. Go to: https://electrify-studio.sanity.studio/
2. Log in with Sanity account
3. Edit content in Studio
4. Click "Publish"
5. **Done!** Changes appear on website in ~30 seconds

### **For You (Developer):**

1. Keep using local dev: `pnpm dev` (still works!)
2. Make code changes
3. Push to GitHub
4. Vercel auto-deploys website
5. **Done!**

**Both workflows are independent!** 🎉

## 🛡️ Security & Backup

### **Access Control:**
- ✅ Your Studio: https://electrify-studio.sanity.studio/
- ✅ Team management: https://sanity.io/manage/project/iedths1l/team
- ✅ 2FA recommended for all team members

### **Backup Strategy:**
- ✅ Manual backups created: `apps/studio/backup-2025-10-23.tar.gz`
- ⏳ Set up automated backups (see: `📚_SANITY_STUDIO_DEPLOYMENT.md`)

### **What's Backed Up:**
- ✅ Code: GitHub (all commits, full history)
- ✅ Deployments: Vercel (can rollback any time)
- ⚠️ Content: Manual Sanity exports (need automation)

## 🚀 Deploy Updates to Studio

When you make changes to Studio code (schemas, etc.):

```bash
cd apps/studio
pnpm build
npx sanity deploy
```

**Or just push to GitHub** - your local dev will always work!
