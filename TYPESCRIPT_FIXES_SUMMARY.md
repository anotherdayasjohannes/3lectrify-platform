# üîß TypeScript Build Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed **7 TypeScript errors** discovered during Vercel production build. All errors were related to interface mismatches between components and their props.

---

## Fixes Applied (In Order)

### 1. FeatureShowcase - Missing `heading` property
**File:** `/app/[slug]/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** Component expected `heading` but only received `title`  
**Fix:** Added `heading: feature.heading` to feature mapping  
**Commit:** `e1c9361`

---

### 2. FeatureShowcase - Missing `sectionIntro` property
**File:** `/app/[slug]/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** `SanityBlock` interface missing `sectionIntro` property  
**Fix:** Added `sectionIntro?: PortableTextBlock[]` to interface  
**Commit:** `f3052d2`

---

### 3. FeatureShowcase - `number` property type mismatch
**File:** `/app/[slug]/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** `number` was optional (`string | undefined`) but component requires `string`  
**Fix:** Changed `number?: string` to `number: string`  
**Commit:** `ed26239`

---

### 4. ReferencesGrid - Missing `headline` and `subtext` props
**File:** `/packages/ui/components/ReferencesGrid.tsx`  
**Issue:** Component had hardcoded text, props not in interface  
**Fix:** Added `headline?: string` and `subtext?: string` to props, made header conditional  
**Commit:** `aa93dcb`

---

### 5. TeamGrid - Missing `heading` property
**File:** `/app/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** `SanityBlock` interface missing `heading` (had `headline` but not `heading`)  
**Fix:** Added `heading?: string` to `SanityBlock` interface  
**Commit:** `9fd5694`

---

### 6. TeamGrid - Incomplete hotspot interface (component)
**File:** `/packages/ui/components/TeamGrid.tsx`  
**Issue:** Hotspot had `{x, y}` but `getFocalPoint()` expects `{x, y, height, width}`  
**Fix:** Added `height: number` and `width: number` to hotspot interface  
**Commit:** `bd296f3`

---

### 7. TeamGrid - Incomplete hotspot interface (page data)
**File:** `/app/[slug]/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** `teamMembers` hotspot had `{x, y}` but component expects `{x, y, height, width}`  
**Fix:** Added `height: number` and `width: number` to teamMembers hotspot in `SanityBlock`  
**Commit:** `dab3555`

---

## Root Causes

### 1. **Interface Misalignment**
Components and their consuming pages had different type definitions for the same props.

### 2. **Incomplete Hotspot Definitions**
Image hotspots were partially defined in some places (`{x, y}`) and completely defined in others (`{x, y, height, width}`), causing type incompatibility with the `getFocalPoint()` utility.

### 3. **Development vs Production TypeScript Strictness**
- **Dev mode (localhost):** More permissive, allowed type mismatches
- **Production build (Vercel):** Strict mode enabled, caught all type errors

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `/app/[slug]/page.tsx` | Added properties to `SanityBlock` interface | Type definitions for dynamic pages |
| `/app/page.tsx` | Added `heading` property | Type definitions for home page |
| `/packages/ui/components/TeamGrid.tsx` | Updated hotspot interface | Complete focal point support |
| `/packages/ui/components/ReferencesGrid.tsx` | Added headline/subtext props | Made component more flexible |

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always define complete interfaces** - Partial type definitions cause issues in strict mode
2. **Hotspot interface should be consistent** - Use `{x, y, height, width}` everywhere
3. **Test production builds locally** - `pnpm build` would have caught these earlier
4. **Component props should match data types** - Interface alignment is critical

## Current Status

‚úÖ All TypeScript errors resolved  
‚úÖ 7 commits pushed to GitHub  
‚è≥ Awaiting Vercel build success

```

**This should be the final push!** üöÄ
