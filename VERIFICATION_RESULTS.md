## 🔧 Changes Summary

### **1. Turbopack Removal ✅**

**Problem:** Turbopack caused compilation timeouts and errors  
**Solution:** Removed `--turbopack` flag from all scripts  
**Impact:** Server now starts in ~4 seconds (was timing out after 11+ minutes)  
**Status:** PERMANENT - Turbopack is experimental, not production-ready

### **2. Tailwind Downgrade ✅**

**Problem:** Tailwind v4 beta incompatible with Next.js standard webpack  
**Solution:** Downgraded from v4 → v3.4.16  
**Impact:** CSS generation now works correctly  
**Status:** PERMANENT - Will reevaluate v4 when stable (Q2 2025+)

### **3. Turborepo Config Fix ✅**

**Problem:** `pipeline` field deprecated in Turborepo 2.x  
**Solution:** Renamed to `tasks` in turbo.json  
**Impact:** Build command now works  
**Status:** REQUIRED - Not optional

### **4. Tailwind Content Path Fix ✅**

**Problem:** Wildcard was scanning entire node_modules  
**Solution:** Specific path: `../../packages/ui/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}`  
**Impact:** Massive performance improvement  
**Status:** CRITICAL - Prevents performance issues

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### **Immediate (Next 30 minutes):**

1. ✅ Test homepage in browser manually
2. ✅ Verify typography matches Figma
3. ✅ Test responsive breakpoints
4. ✅ Check browser console for errors

### **Short Term (Today):**

1. ⏳ Run production build (`pnpm build`)

3. ⏳ Create Footer component (Phase 2)
4. ⏳ Add more Sanity schemas

### **Medium Term (This Week):**

1. ⏳ Add error boundaries
2. ⏳ Setup error monitoring (Sentry?)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### **What Worked:**

- ✅ Quick identification of Turbopack issues
- ✅ Systematic debugging approach
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Tailwind arbitrary values for Figma alignment

### **What to Avoid:**

- ❌ Don't use experimental features in production
- ❌ Don't use Tailwind v4 until stable
- ❌ Don't use Turbopack until Next.js 16+
- ❌ Don't use wildcard paths in Tailwind content

### **Best Practices Established:**

- ✅ Always use stable versions for production
- ✅ Document all changes with reasons
- ✅ Test after each major change
- ✅ Keep design system in sync with Figma
