# üîç Pin Jump Fixes - Attempted Solutions Log

**Problem:** 12px upward jump when GSAP ScrollTrigger pins the FeatureCards section.

**Diagnostic Data:**
```
Frame 221: -12px shift (negative = moved UP)
Section position: STILL relative (not fixed yet)
No CSS property changes detected
```

This means the jump happens **BEFORE** the position changes, indicating a **layout recalculation issue**.

## ‚ùå Attempt 1: GPU Layer with transform properties

**What we tried:**
```tsx
style={{ 
  willChange: 'transform',
  transform: 'translateZ(0)',
  backfaceVisibility: 'hidden'
}}
```

**Theory:** Force browser to create a GPU compositing layer before the pin, preventing layout recalculation.

**Result:** FAILED - Jump increased to 26px (worse!)

**Why it failed:** GPU layers don't prevent layout recalculation, only rendering optimization.

---

## ‚ùå Attempt 2: Transform origin + positioning hints

**What we tried:**
```tsx
style={{ 
  willChange: 'transform',
  transform: 'translate3d(0,0,0)',
  transformOrigin: 'top left',
  backfaceVisibility: 'hidden',
  top: 0,
  left: 0
}}
```

**Theory:** Give browser exact coordinates to prevent position calculation mismatch.

**Result:** FAILED - Still 12px jump

**Why it failed:** The jump happens during layout recalculation, not position calculation.

---

## ‚ùå Attempt 3: Nested Block Formatting Context (BFC)

**What we tried:**
```tsx
<section className="... overflow-hidden">
  <div className="content-wrapper overflow-hidden"> {/* Added this */}
```

**Theory:** Create BFC at both section and wrapper level to prevent margin collapse at all layers.

**Result:** FAILED - Cards were clipped, jump still present

**Why it failed:** 
- `overflow-hidden` clipped card bottoms (hover effects + shadows extend beyond bounds)
- Didn't address the root cause (layout recalculation)

---

## üîÑ Attempt 4: CSS Layout Containment (CURRENT)

**What we're trying:**
```tsx
style={{ 
  contain: 'layout',
  isolation: 'isolate'
}}
```

**Theory:** 
- `contain: layout` ‚Üí Tells browser internal layout is isolated from external layout
- `isolation: isolate` ‚Üí Creates new stacking context
- When GSAP prepares for pin, layout recalculation stops at our boundary

**Status:** TESTING - Awaiting diagnostic results

---

## üîÆ Next Attempts If This Fails:

### Option 5: GSAP invalidateOnRefresh
```tsx
scrollTrigger: {
  // ... existing config
  invalidateOnRefresh: true
}
```
Force GSAP to recalculate all values on every scroll refresh.

### Option 6: Manual position locking with GSAP
```tsx
// Set exact position before pin
gsap.set(containerRef.current, {
  y: 0,
  force3D: true
});
```

### Option 7: Accept the micro-jump
If < 2px, might be browser sub-pixel rounding - acceptable for production.

## üìä Diagnostic Commands

**Run this in browser console:**
```javascript
// See DEBUG_PIN_JUMP.js file
// Monitors position changes frame-by-frame
// Logs jumps > 0.5px with style change details
```

**What to look for:**
- Jump magnitude (< 1px = success)
- Frame number when jump occurs
- CSS properties that changed
- Position: relative vs fixed

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

- Jump < 1px (imperceptible to users)
- No card clipping
- Smooth pin transition
- No performance degradation
