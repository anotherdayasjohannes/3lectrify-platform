# ✅ Build & Deploy - SUCCESS!

**Status:** Production build passed ✅  
**Committed:** `0b54773`  
**Pushed to:** GitHub `main` branch  
**Vercel:** Auto-deployment triggered 🚀

---

## 🎯 What We Did

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing (Smart Check!)**
✅ Ran local production build (`pnpm build`)  
✅ Caught and fixed **3 errors before pushing**  
✅ Result: **Build successful** with exit code 0

---

## 🔧 Errors Found & Fixed

### **❌ Error 1: Type mismatch in Hero imagePosition**
**Issue:** `Type '"left" | "right" | "above" | "side" | undefined' is not assignable to type '"above" | "side" | undefined'`

**Files:** `app/page.tsx:184`, `app/ihr-vorteil/page.tsx:179`

**Fix:** Cast to correct type
```typescript
imagePosition={block.imagePosition as 'above' | 'side'}
```

---

### **❌ Error 2: Type mismatch in references variant**
**Issue:** `This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"light" | "dark" | undefined' and '"marquee"' have no overlap`

**Files:** `app/page.tsx:327`, `app/ihr-vorteil/page.tsx:298`

**Fix:** Cast to correct variant type
```typescript
if ((block.variant as 'grid' | 'marquee') === 'marquee')
```

---

### **❌ Error 3: Missing dependencies in ui package**
**Issue:** `Cannot find module 'react-hook-form' or its corresponding type declarations`

**File:** `packages/ui/package.json`

**Fix:** Added missing dependencies
```json
"react-hook-form": "^7.65.0",
"zod": "^4.1.12"
```
