## 📸 Your 3 Images Checklist

From your photos, you have:
- ✅ Image 1: Aerial view from LEFT angle
- ✅ Image 2: Aerial view from CENTER (straight on)
- ✅ Image 3: Aerial view from RIGHT angle

**Perfect for parallax!** 🏢

## 🎨 Effect Comparison - Try Them All!

**Morning:** Try Mouse Tracking first  
**Afternoon:** Switch to Auto-Rotate  
**Evening:** Test Layered Depth  

Each one tells a different story!

---

## ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Use consistent image dimensions** (all 3 should be same width/height)
2. **Center image should be the "main" view** (default state)
3. **Left/Right should be subtle angle changes** (not 90° different)
4. **Optimize images before upload** (< 200KB each for fast loading)

---

## 🎓 Advanced Options (Later)

Once basic parallax works, you can:
- Try different effect types
- Adjust image positions (above/side)
- Combine with text reveal animations
- Add to other pages
