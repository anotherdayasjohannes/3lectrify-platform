# üõ°Ô∏è Cursor Development Protocol - Safety First

**Purpose:** Prevent production breaks, enable safe experimentation, ensure rollback capability
**Created:** 2025-10-29
**Learned from:** Oct 28, 2025 Production Crisis
**Status:** MANDATORY for all development

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Core Principle: Never Break Production

**Rules:**
1. **NEVER work directly on `main` branch** for features/changes
2. **ALWAYS test incrementally** (not at the end)
3. **ALWAYS create backup branch** before risky changes
4. **ALWAYS verify in dev server** before committing
5. **NEVER force push to main** without explicit approval
6. **NEVER make changes without explicit approval** - Show plan first, wait for "go"

**Why:** These rules prevented data loss during Oct 28 crisis and will prevent future incidents.

---

## üö® Common Mistake: Jumping Ahead

### **DON'T Do This:**
```
‚ùå Read implementation plan
‚ùå Understand what needs to change
‚ùå Start making changes immediately
‚ùå "I'll just do it real quick"
```

**Problem:** No verification, no approval, breaks conductor model

### **DO This Instead:**
```
‚úÖ Read implementation plan
‚úÖ Create plan/summary of what you'll do
‚úÖ SHOW plan to Johannes
‚úÖ WAIT for approval ("go ahead", "approved", etc.)
‚úÖ THEN make changes one at a time
```

**Why:** The conductor (Johannes) must give the downbeat. The orchestra doesn't start playing on its own.

### **Example (Correct Flow):**

**Cursor:**
> "I've read the plan. Here's what I'll do:
> 1. Change file A (line X)
> 2. Change file B (line Y)
> 3. Test after each change
>
> Ready to proceed?"

**Johannes:**
> "Approved. Start with file A."

**Cursor:**
> "Making change to file A..."

**This is the only acceptable workflow.**

## üå≥ Git Strategy

### **Branch Workflow**

#### **For Small Changes (1-3 files, low risk):**
```bash
# Current workflow - acceptable for minor fixes
git checkout main
# Make change
# Test in dev server
git add [specific files]
git commit -m "fix: [description]"
# DON'T push yet - verify first
pnpm dev
# Test in browser
# If good:
git push origin main
```

#### **For Medium/Large Changes (Multiple files, new features):**
```bash
# MANDATORY workflow

# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/marion-feedback-typography
# or: feature/[description]

# 2. Make changes incrementally (one section at a time)
# Change file 1
# Test in dev server ‚úÖ
# Commit
git add [file1]
git commit -m "feat: update typography to 18px"

# Change file 2
# Test in dev server ‚úÖ
# Commit
git add [file2]
git commit -m "feat: remove font-light classes"

# 3. When section complete and verified
# Push feature branch (safe, not production)
git push origin feature/marion-feedback-typography

# 4. Verify everything works
pnpm dev
# Full testing in browser

# 5. Merge to main ONLY when confirmed working
git checkout main
git merge feature/marion-feedback-typography
git push origin main
```

#### **For Risky/Experimental Changes:**
```bash
# ALWAYS create backup first

# 1. Create backup branch
git checkout -b backup-before-[change-name]-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup-before-[change-name]-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b experiment/[description]

# 3. Make changes
# 4. Test extensively
# 5. If works: merge to main
# 6. If fails: delete branch, restore from backup

# Backup branch preserves all work - zero data loss
```

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Incremental Testing (MANDATORY)**

**Rule:** Test after EVERY logical change, not just at the end.

#### **Bad (What caused Oct 28 crisis):**
```bash
# Change 10 files (780 lines)
# Run dev server once at end
# Discover everything broken
# Panic
```

#### **Good (Prevents crisis):**
```bash
# Change file 1
pnpm dev
# Verify in browser ‚úÖ

# Change file 2
# Refresh browser
# Verify ‚úÖ

# Change file 3
# Refresh browser
# Verify ‚úÖ

# All changes tested incrementally = confidence
```

---

### **Dev Server Protocol**

#### **Starting Dev Server:**
```bash
cd /Users/j.wild/Projects/3lectrify-platform

# Check which app to run
# Option 1: 3lectrify (main site)
pnpm --filter 3lectrify dev
# Opens: http://localhost:3000

# Option 2: All apps (if needed)
pnpm dev
```

#### **While Dev Server Running:**

**After EACH code change:**
1. Save file in Cursor
2. Wait for "compiled successfully" in terminal
3. Refresh browser (Cmd+R)
4. Verify change worked
5. Check console for errors (F12)

**If errors appear:**
- STOP immediately
- Read error message
- Fix before continuing
- Don't stack changes on broken code

**If change looks wrong:**
- STOP immediately
- `git diff` to see what changed
- Revert if needed: `git checkout [file]`
- Re-think approach

---

### **Testing Checklist (Before Committing)**

**Minimum verification (every commit):**
- [ ] Dev server runs without errors
- [ ] Page loads without console errors
- [ ] Changed element looks correct
- [ ] No obvious visual breaks

**Full verification (before merging to main):**
- [ ] All pages tested:
  - [ ] Homepage (/)
  - [ ] /ihr-vorteil
  - [ ] /unser-konzept
  - [ ] /ueber-uns
  - [ ] /kontakt
- [ ] No console errors on any page
- [ ] Animations work smoothly
- [ ] Responsive (test at 1920px, 1440px, mobile)
- [ ] No layout shifts

---

## üîÑ Safe Change Process (Step-by-Step)

### **For Each Implementation Section:**

#### **Step 1: Setup (Safety First)**
```bash
# If risky: create backup
git checkout -b backup-before-section-X-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup-before-section-X-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Create feature branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/section-X-[description]

# Start dev server
pnpm --filter 3lectrify dev
```

#### **Step 2: Implement (Small Changes)**
```bash
# Read implementation plan
# Identify FIRST file to change

# Make change in file 1
# Save

# IMMEDIATELY test:
# - Refresh browser
# - Verify change
# - Check console

# If good: commit
git add [file1]
git commit -m "feat: [specific change]"

# If bad: revert
git checkout [file1]
# Re-think approach
```

#### **Step 3: Iterate (One File at a Time)**
```bash
# Repeat for each file:
# Change ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Commit
# Change ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Commit
# Change ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Commit

# NOT: Change, change, change, hope it works
```

#### **Step 4: Section Complete (Full Verification)**
```bash
# All files in section changed
# Dev server still running

# Full test:
# - Visit all pages
# - Check all changed elements
# - Look for side effects
# - Console errors?

# If all good:
git push origin feature/section-X-[description]

# Notify Johannes: "Section X complete, ready to verify"
```

#### **Step 5: Merge (Johannes Approval)**
```bash
# After Johannes verifies and approves:

git checkout main
git merge feature/section-X-[description]

# Optional: Squash commits if many
# git merge --squash feature/section-X-[description]

# Push to production
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys
# Monitor for 2-3 minutes
# Check production URL
```

---

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### **Scenario: "I broke the dev server"**

```bash
# 1. DON'T PANIC
# 2. Read error message carefully
# 3. Check what you just changed:
git diff

# 4. Revert last change:
git checkout [broken-file]

# 5. Restart dev server:
# Ctrl+C (stop)
pnpm --filter 3lectrify dev

# 6. If still broken:
git status
# Revert all uncommitted changes:
git checkout .

# 7. If STILL broken:
# Might be package.json changes
pnpm install

# 8. Last resort:
git log --oneline -5
git reset --hard [last-good-commit]
```

---

### **Scenario: "I committed something wrong"**

```bash
# If not pushed yet:
git log --oneline -3
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit, keep changes
# Fix
# Recommit

# If already pushed to feature branch:
# Not a problem - just fix and commit again

# If already pushed to main (DANGER):
# 1. STOP
# 2. Tell Johannes immediately
# 3. Create backup branch
# 4. Assess damage
# 5. May need force push (Johannes decision)
```

---

### **Scenario: "Everything is broken, need to start over"**

```bash
# If you have backup branch:
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup-before-[name]-[date]
git push --force origin main  # Johannes must approve

# If no backup (bad situation):
git log --oneline -20
# Find last known good commit
git reset --hard [commit-hash]
git push --force origin main  # Johannes must approve

# Lesson: ALWAYS create backup for risky changes
```

---

## üìù Commit Message Standards

### **Format:**
```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional refs]
```

### **Types:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `refactor:` Code change (no behavior change)
- `style:` Visual/CSS changes
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance

### **Examples:**

**Good:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: update body text to 18px regular

- Changed tailwind.config.ts base text size
- Updated all font-light to font-normal
- Verified across all pages

Refs: Marion feedback #1"
```

**Bad:**
```bash
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
```

---

## üéØ Component-Specific Guidelines

### **Shared Components (packages/ui/)**

**EXTRA CAUTION:** Changes here affect ALL apps

**Protocol:**
```bash
# 1. Always create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/component-[name]-update

# 2. Change component
# 3. Test in 3lectrify app FIRST
pnpm --filter 3lectrify dev

# 4. If working, test in other apps (if they exist)
# 5. Commit only when verified

# 6. Document what changed:
git commit -m "feat(ui): update FeatureCards background color

Changed bg from default to #3C5067 per design feedback.
Verified in 3lectrify app.

Refs: Marion feedback #6"
```

---

### **App-Specific (apps/3lectrify/)**

**Lower risk:** Only affects 3lectrify

**Protocol:**
```bash
# Can work on main for small changes
# Feature branch for larger changes

# Always test before commit
pnpm --filter 3lectrify dev
```

---

## üîç Code Review Checklist (Self-Review Before Commit)

**Before committing, ask yourself:**

- [ ] Did I test this change in dev server?
- [ ] Does the page load without errors?
- [ ] Did I check the browser console?
- [ ] Does this match the implementation plan?
- [ ] Did I only change what was needed? (no scope creep)
- [ ] Is my commit message clear?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable pushing this to production?

**If any answer is "no" ‚Üí FIX before committing**

---

## üéì Lessons from Oct 28 Crisis

### **What Went Wrong:**
1. ‚ùå Worked directly on main (no feature branch)
2. ‚ùå Changed 10 files / 780 lines at once
3. ‚ùå Didn't test incrementally
4. ‚ùå Build succeeded but runtime failed
5. ‚ùå Had to emergency revert

### **What Saved Us:**
1. ‚úÖ Created backup branch before reverting
2. ‚úÖ Git allowed hard reset to known good state
3. ‚úÖ Force push restored production in 30 minutes
4. ‚úÖ Zero data loss (backup preserved work)
5. ‚úÖ Documentation during crisis helped

### **New Rules (Prevent Recurrence):**
1. ‚úÖ ALWAYS feature branch for multi-file changes
2. ‚úÖ ALWAYS test after each file change
3. ‚úÖ ALWAYS create backup for risky changes
4. ‚úÖ NEVER assume build success = runtime success
5. ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify in browser before commit

## üöÄ Quick Reference

### **Starting Work:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[description]

# 2. Start dev server
pnpm --filter 3lectrify dev

# 3. Open browser
http://localhost:3000

# 4. Make changes one at a time
# 5. Test after each change
# 6. Commit when verified
```

### **Committing:**
```bash
git add [specific files]
git commit -m "type: description"
git push origin feature/[branch]
```

### **Merging to Production:**
```bash
# After Johannes approval:
git checkout main
git merge feature/[branch]
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys
# Monitor production
```

### **Emergency Revert:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5
git reset --hard [last-good-commit]
git push --force origin main  # Johannes approval required
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

**A safe development session:**
- ‚úÖ Feature branch used (not main directly)
- ‚úÖ Each change tested before next change
- ‚úÖ Dev server ran without errors throughout
- ‚úÖ All commits have clear messages
- ‚úÖ Johannes verified before production push
- ‚úÖ No surprises in production
- ‚úÖ Rollback plan exists

**An unsafe development session:**
- ‚ùå Working on main directly
- ‚ùå Many changes without testing
- ‚ùå Dev server errors ignored
- ‚ùå Vague commit messages
- ‚ùå Push to production without verification
- ‚ùå No backup plan

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Commit Often**
```
Don't hoard changes. Small commits = easy to revert.
Better: 10 small commits than 1 giant commit
```

### **Tip 2: Descriptive Branch Names**
```
Good: feature/marion-feedback-typography
Good: fix/stacked-cards-jump-bug
Good: experiment/new-animation-approach

Bad: fix
Bad: changes
Bad: test
```

### **Tip 3: Keep Dev Server Running**
```
Don't restart for every change.
Hot reload is your friend.
Restart only if package.json changes or weird errors.
```

### **Tip 4: Trust Your Eyes**
```
If something looks wrong in browser, it IS wrong.
Don't convince yourself it's okay.
Fix it before moving on.
```

### **Tip 5: When in Doubt, Backup**
```
Backup branch costs nothing.
Emergency revert costs everything.
```
